# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O [C, Algorithm, Data structure]
## Learning Objectives:
- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm

                                 Project/Task Questions

### Task 0. Bubble sort

Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
- Prototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);
- Youâ€™re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
- in the best case
- in the average case
- in the worst case
